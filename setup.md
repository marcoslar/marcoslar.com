### Hardware

My first ~~and current~~ laptop was a 
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp719?locale=en_US">MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)</a>
with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 
I've bought it in 2016 because back then I started to use Macs at work, and I 
ended up liking them. This machine still works like the first day!
Before the Mac I used to have a regular desktop computer with Windows and Ubuntu; you know,
the ones you have to assemble by yourself. I got the Mac just before I moved to Germany, 
so that was another reason to buy a laptop.
In 2022 I got myself an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP858?locale=en_GB">M1 MacBook Pro</a> (what a beast!).

Monitor: <a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/2bb31592">Dell U2719D</a>. 
Not bad, but from time to time a vertical blue line appears on the left side
of the screen and doesn't go away until I disconnect all the cables and reset the monitor. Annoying.

I'm using a generic Logitech mouse (wired), and an Apple Magic Keyboard (old model). 
I'm not that picky when it comes to peripherals, and I may try one day one of those 
@{cool||noisy||heavy}@ mechanical keyboards.

And the best hardware device I ever bought is my 
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp592?locale=en_US">iPOD shuffle (4th generation)</a>. 
I don't remember exactly when I bought it (perhaps in 2014?), but it still works like the first day.
Impressive because this guy uses a Lithium-ion battery that, in theory, should have 
already went south. I use my iPOD every week when running or playing outdoors. The most inconvenient
part would be that the jack/usb cable is very fragile (the original one got broken and then lost).

In 2022 I got myself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SanDisk_portable_media_players#SanDisk_Clip_Sport_Go">
SanDisk Clip Sport Go</a>. Pretty decent! It's a bit bigger than the
iPOD shuffle, but I can definitely carry it on my pocket (the clip is strong enough to carry
the device hanging from the jacket).

The second-best piece of hardware I have is the Kindle Scribe. I bought it in 2024 and
primarily use it for reading the tons of @{pirated books|| books}@ I have on my hard drive. 
It's big, so PDFs fit just fine. The best part is the battery, it usually lasts over a month 
without needing a charge.

### Software

These days I try to run as much as I can in virtual machines.
Nevertheless, this is a list of some programs I have installed in my laptop:

- IntelliJ IDEA (e.g., Goland, PyCharm)
- Vim
- iTerm2
- <s>Vagrant</s> Multipass
- Docker
- <s>VMware</s> QEMU
- Git
- Chrome, Firefox
- f.lux
- VLC
- OpenEmu
- Zotero
- JupyterLab
