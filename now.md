Things I'm doing at the moment.

- I'm working (sparingly) on a project I call GJ
- I'm redesigning this website
- I'm trying to fix an additional iPOD shuffle I bought as a backup for my main one. Somehow I think
that because it was all the time sitting there without me using it, the battery has drained and 
it doesn't start anymore
