### About this site

@{This is just another site on the web.||This is one of the top 500 sites 
on the web according to [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/topsites).}@ 
In the past it has lived under different names—and perhaps it has belonged
to different owners—but at the moment its name has a [weird suffix][1] on it.

If there is anything that may distinguish this site from others, it is
what I call a *parallel web site* (or *parasite*, or *parablog*). This means that 
for every page P on this site, multiple versions of P may exist, all coexisting
under the same URL. Take this page as an example: refresh the page 
and you may get a different version of it; a version that conveys the same 
meaning (@{sometimes||most of the time}@) but is written in a different way. 
You can find out more about this idea in the post [Parallel Blogs][2].
@{It's a silly idea,||It's a tremendous idea,}@ I know.

This site is built with [belbo][3].  
This site has been online since @{2012||1998||2006}@.

### About me
<i>I'm Marcos.
To the other one, to Marcos, is to whom things happen. From Marcos 
I find out through the e-mail and I see his name in a list of 
meeting attendees, in the output of <small>`git blame`</small>, or in a Rundfunkbeitrag 
bill. I like to read books, to take walks with my wife, to go out for 
a run from time to time, maps, <i>fútbol</i> juggling, and computer programming; 
he shares these preferences too, but in a vain way that turns them 
into the attributes of an actor. Little by little, I am giving over 
everything to him, although I am quite aware of his perverse custom 
of falsifying and magnifying things (he usually talks to his colleagues 
using terms like SOLID, *good practices*, DDD... and I 
never fully understand it).
I enjoy very much the act of creating something (anything) from 
scratch, and at work I don't practice this as much as I would like, 
but Marcos always insists in making these creations useful in some
way... I never fully understood that either.</i>
