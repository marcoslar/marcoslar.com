For the past few weeks I've been listening to various vaporwave
artists on Soundcloud, Bandcamp and Youtube. Nice discovery.
Just to name a few: [Home - Resonance],
[MACINTOSH PLUS - リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー],
[Saint Pepsi - Private Caller].

Especially the last one, there is a [comment on Youtube] that describes
it very well:

> This feels like living in a postapocalypctic neon cyberpunk future locked inside
a garage while on drugs and watching vhs tapes over and over again.


You know, A E S T H E T I C S.
