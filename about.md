## About this site

@{This is just another site on the web.||This is one of the top 500 sites 
on the web according to [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/topsites).}@ 
In the past it has lived under different names---and perhaps it has belonged
to different owners---but at the moment its name has a very silly prefix 
on it.  
If there is anything that may distinguish this site from others is that 
it is what I call a *parallel web site* (or *parasite*). This means that for every page P
on this site, there may exist multiple versions of P and all of them co-exist 
under the same URL of P. Take this page as an example: refresh the page 
and you may get a different version of it; a version 
that conveys the same meaning (@{sometimes||most of the time}@) but it's
written in a different way. You can find out more about this 
idea in the post [Parallel Blogs](https://www.lessmarcos.com/posts/2020/08/parallel-blogs/).
@{It's a silly idea,||It's a tremendous idea,}@ I know.

This site is built with [belbo](https://github.com/lessmarcos/belbo).  
This site has been online since @{2012||1998}@.

## About me

I'm Marcos.  
To the other one, to Marcos, is to whom things happen. From Marcos 
I find out through the e-mail and I see his name in a list of 
meeting attendees, in the output of `git blame`, or in a Rundfunkbeitrag 
bill. I like to read books, to take walks with my wife, to go out for 
a run from time to time, maps, <i>f√∫tbol</i> juggling, and computer programming; 
he shares these preferences too, but in a vain way that turns them 
into the attributes of an actor. Little by little, I am giving over 
everything to him, although I am quite aware of his perverse custom 
of falsifying and magnifying things (he usually talks to his colleagues 
using terms like SOLID, *good practices*, DDD... and I 
never fully understand it).  
I enjoy very much the act of creating something (anything) from 
scratch (at work I don't practice this as much as I would like), 
but Marcos always insists in making these creations useful in some
way... I never fully understood that either.
