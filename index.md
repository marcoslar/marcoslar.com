<p class="intro">
    I’m Marcos. I live with my wonderful wife @{(<i>naber canım!</i>)||}@ in Germany,
    where I work as a computer programmer.
    This site is just the place where I try to archive my stuff,
    so if it’s prose you may find grammar mistakes; if it’s code you’ll
    definitely find bugs. Less is more… but in the case of this website
    I should say less is a bore (I’m working on it).
