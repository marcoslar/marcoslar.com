<h1 style="margin-top:10px;">Hi</h1>

I'm Marcos. I live with my wonderful wife (_naber canÄ±m!_) in Germany,
where I work as a computer programmer.

I like to start new things from scratch, but I'm not 
an accomplisher. Stories, drawings, tracks, code; all half done, but all
my own. Sometimes I share my stuff here. Anyway, in an alternate universe 
I'm sure I've worked on something tremendous. Meanwhile, 
in this universe, you can check what I'm doing <a href="/now/">right now</a>, 
read some <a href="/sessions/">stuff</a> I have written in the past, or 
find out more <a href="/about/">about me</a> and 
<a href="/about/">this site</a>.

`lessmarcos.com` is just the place where I try to archive my stuff, so 
if it's prose you may find grammar mistakes; if it's code you'll 
definitely find bugs. Less is more... but in the case of this website 
I should say <i>less is a bore</i> (I'm working on it).

I am also not available on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, nor IMDb.
On YouTube maybe, stay tuned.
