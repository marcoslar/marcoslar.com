In recent versions of Jetbrain's IDEs, the action "Annotate with Git Blame" does not
open a single floating window anymore. Instead it displays a window with 
Git branches, commits and what not. Can be disabled via the IDE registry 
(Shift + ⌘ + A, on Mac): `vcs.blame.show.affected.files.in.log`

GitLab's [Dependency Proxy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/index.html)
[doesn't seem to support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349466) multi-architecture upstream image repositories 😔

I discovered GitLab's [Dependency Proxy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/index.html). It's like a private cache for Docker images, and
available in the free tier 🤑

Bought a new domain name. Changed the silly prefix for a more decent
<a href="http://www.marcoslar.com/#:~:text=The%20lar%20suffix%20in%20the%20domain%20name%20is%20the%20plural%20form%20of%20my%20surname%20in%20the%20Turkish%20language">suffix</a>.

I changed the design of the website one more time. I actually kinda like it now.

While I appreciate tools like `go fmt`, I think third-party linters add little value to already
existing projects. Code changes all the time, structure (should) remain more ore less stable; 
let's focus on the big picture! An extra semicolon is not going to make the project easier 
(or harder) to read or maintain---consistency in the upper layers of abstraction brings more
value (e.g., don't put business logic in the transport layer, proper error logging, don't use
logs when metrics are enough, good commit messages for important features, etc.)

Once again I have changed the style of the website. I had to update [belbo] to support content
in multiple directories (see [`817bd5b`](https://github.com/marcoslar/belbo/commit/817bd5b170e5ebeb93e55e0cae2a2b444d6fff96)),
but it turned out I actually didn't need the feature.
