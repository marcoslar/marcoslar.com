<h1 style="margin-top:10px;">Hi</h1>

I'm Marcos. I live with my wonderful wife (naber canÄ±m!) in Germany, 
where I work as a computer programmer. 

Computers are OK, but what I really enjoy is pen and paper. 
Notes, sketches, and usually everything I make goes through paper first. 
There is a paper version of this website somewhere in a folder 
on my desk.<br>
I enjoy starting new things, and I rarely finish them. Combine this
and my fixation on paper, and you get: Not much to brag about online. 
Anyway, in an alternate universe I'm sure I've worked on something that 
revolutionized the IT world. Meanwhile, in this universe, you can 
check what I'm doing <a href="/now/">right now</a>, read some 
<a href="/sessions/">stuff</a> I have written in the past, or find out 
more <a href="/about/">about me</a> and <a href="/about/">this site</a>.

`lessmarcos.com` is the place where I archive my stuff, so if 
it's prose you may find grammar mistakes; if it's code you'll 
definitely find bugs.
Less is more... but in the case of this website I should say <i>less is
a bore</i> (I'm working on it!)

I am also not available on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, nor IMDb.
