title = "K8s primer - Part I"

*This primer is targeted to developers who mainly work on product features but 
may also need to understand the basics of Kubernetes at a practical level,
so that they know how their applications are deployed and managed.*

*Requirements: [Docker] and [minikube].*

*If you are already familiarized with building containerized applications, you can
skip directly to [step 4](#4).*

*Second part in [K8s Primer - Part II](/)*

### <a name="1" href="#one">1. Alright, let's start</a>
We want to deploy a [Go] application using [Kubernetes (K8s)]. The application is 
a simple HTTP server that listens on port 7070 and responds to any request with 
a "Hello world" followed by a random integer.


*File `./main.go`*
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
	id := rand.Int()

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello world (ID: %d)\n", id)
	})

	fmt.Printf("Serving on http://localhost:7070 (ID: %d)\n", id)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":7070", nil))
}
```

We can run this HTTP server locally on your personal machine:

```
$ go build main.go && ./main # Or just: go run main.go
Serving on http://localhost:7070 (ID: 3628456987918824506)
```

And we can query the server using [curl]:

```
$ curl localhost:7070
Hello world (ID: 3628456987918824506)
```

So far so good.

### <a href="#2" name="2">2. K8s runs containerized applications</a>
We cannot just deploy our Go app by "handing over" the compiled binary `main` 
to K8s. K8s runs applications within containers. We need to containerize our 
Go app; I'll use [Docker] for that:

*File `./Dockerfile`*
```
FROM golang:1.19-alpine3.15 as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY main.go ./
RUN go build -o /app/HelloWorld main.go
EXPOSE 7070

FROM alpine:3.15
USER nobody:nobody
COPY --from=build /app/HelloWorld /HelloWorld

CMD ["/HelloWorld"]
```

The `./Dockerfile` contains all the commands needed to build an image that
will contain our application binary. Let's build the image:

```
$ docker build -t YOUR-HANDLE/hello-world-go:1.0.0 .
```

The image is now stored in our personal machine: 

```
$ docker image ls                                                
REPOSITORY                     TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
YOUR-HANDLE/hello-world-go   1.0.0     a2fe58fdd36f   2 seconds ago    11.6MB
```

We could run our containerized Go app locally by doing:

```
$ docker run --rm -p 7070:7070 YOUR-HANDLE/hello-world-go:1.0.0

Serving on http://localhost:7070 (ID: 3888774625775762015)
```

And we can query our containerized Go app just like before: `curl localhost:7070`.

### <a href="#3" name="3">3. Let's publish our Go application image</a>

The image we just built is stored in our personal machine, but K8s doesn't know how
to retrieve the image from our file system. The standard approach is to make our container 
image available via a container registry. I'll use [Docker Hub] to publish (for free) 
my Go app image:

```
$ docker login -u YOUR-HANDLE
$ docker push YOUR-HANDLE/hello-world-go:1.0.0
```

(_`docker login` will ask for your [personal access token] to login into Docker Hub._)

Now our Go app image is publicly available via Docker Hub.

### <a href="#4" name="4">4. We need some kind of machine/server/node where K8s can run</a>

If we want to run applications on K8s, we first need to figure out
where K8s can run. We need hardware. We can use a fully managed K8s 
service like [GKE] and [EKS], or we can use [minikube], open source and free, to 
run K8s locally on our machine. I'll use minikube. 

K8s has the notion of [clusters]. A cluster is a set of nodes. A node can be a 
physical or a virtual machine. We can run K8s itself and our application on nodes.

Let's create a local K8s cluster of three (virtual) nodes:

```
$ minikube start --nodes 3 -p minikube-lab
```

Nice. We got three nodes. Let's use [kubectl], a CLI that lets us interact with K8s,
to ask K8s about the status of our cluster:

```
$ kubectl get nodes

NAME               STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
minikube-lab       Ready    control-plane   1h    v1.25.2
minikube-lab-m02   Ready    <none>          58s   v1.25.2
minikube-lab-m03   Ready    <none>          58s   v1.25.2
```

K8s is telling us that we have three nodes, each of them with a unique name and
ready for whatever we may need them. One of the nodes works as the [control plane]
of our cluster (i.e., this is where most of the K8s components run to manage the cluster), 
while the other two nodes are what K8s calls [worker] nodes (i.e., nodes on which 
our application can run.)

### <a href="#5" name="5">5. Let's deploy our Go app in our local K8s cluster</a>

We got a cluster and we got a containerized application, but can't yet deploy our 
containerized application on the cluster.
We first need a [Pod]. A Pod can be thought of as a wrapper that allows a container
to run on K8s. It's true that we can run containerized apps on K8s, but K8s requires 
that any container runs inside a Pod.

<div class="img-block">
    <img class="img-center" 
         src="/static/img/k8s/app-container-pod-2.svg" 
         alt="App within container within Pod"
         width="350" height="350"
    >
    <div class="caption">
        <small><b>Fig. 1</b> Go app within container within Pod.</small>
    </div>
</div>

Let's create our Pod in a declarative way:

*File `./k8s/pod.yaml`*
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: helloworld-app
  labels:
    app: helloworld-backend
spec:
  containers:
    - image: mypublicrepos/hello-world-go:1.0.0
      name: helloworld-container
      ports:
        - containerPort: 7070
          name: http
          protocol: TCP
```

This YAML file, also known as a Pod [manifest], declares the desired state of our cluster.
We are telling K8s:

> Hey K8s, create one Pod named `helloworld-app` which contains inside one container 
> named `helloworld-container` whose image can be pulled from `YOUR-HANDLE/hello-world-go:1.0.0` 
> (from DockerHub) and that runs on port 7070

- `kind`: identifies the type of object being declared. We are declaring a Pod 
- `apiVersion`: defines the schema version we'll use when creating the Pod object. 
We are using the Pod schema `v1`
- `metadata.*`: this section describes the Pod (its name, its labels, annotations, etc.). 
We identify Pods by their name. We use labels to group Pods together
- `spec.*`: this part describes the list of containers that will run within the Pod. 
We are declaring a single container, its image and its port

Now we are finally ready to deploy our app.

### <a href="#6" name="6">6. Let's deploy a Pod!</a>

We can use `kubectl` (alias `k`) to submit our `./k8s/pod.yaml` manifest to K8s. 
Behind the curtains a lot things will happen, but what we care about here is that K8s 
will find a healthy node on our cluster on which our Pod can run:

```
$ k apply -f k8s/pod.yaml
pod/helloworld-app created
```

We can check if the Pod is in our cluster, but you may want to wait a little bit
before running the following command (it may take some time to pull the 
image container):

```
$ k get pods -o wide                                                                        
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE               NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
helloworld-app   1/1     Running   0          2m11s   10.244.2.2   minikube-lab-m03   <none>           <none>
```

Our Pod is there. It's running on the node `minikube-lab-m03` (a worker node),
and it even has its own IP address (`10.244.2.2`). Let's get more details about our Pod:

```
$ k describe pod helloworld-app

  Normal  Started    4m13s  kubelet            Started container helloworld-container
```

That's a lot of information. Some remarkable stuff:

- The `namespace` of the Pod is `default`. [Namespaces] provide a mechanism 
for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. We didn't specify 
any namespace in our Pod manifest, so our Pod got the default one
- Our Pod has one label (`app=helloworld-backend`) which is useful for filtering and 
grouping Pods as we'll see later
- Our Pod is running one container named `helloworld-container` which hasn't 
suffered any restarts yet
- There are some events attached to our Pod (container creation, image pulling, 
scheduling of the Pod to a node)

### <a href="#7" name="7">7. What can (cannot) we do with our Pod?</a>

We

- can query its state (as seen before)
- can delete it (`k delete pod helloworld-app`)
- can recreate it (first delete and then create again)
- can reach it by its IP address
- cannot modify it (Pods are immutable)
- cannot reach it from outside the K8s cluster

From our local machine we cannot query the Go app running in the Pod. While the Pod 
has an IP address, the IP is only reachable from within the K8s cluster. Check this out:

```
$ curl 10.244.2.2:7070 
curl: (28) Failed to connect to 10.244.2.2 port 7070: Operation timed out
```

Can't reach the Pod from my local machine. Let's SSH into one of the nodes of the 
K8s cluster and try to query our Go app from there:

```
$ minikube ssh -p minikube-lab -n minikube-lab-m02
Last login: Fri Nov 11 20:00:05 2022 from 192.168.49.1
docker@minikube-lab-m02:~$ curl 10.244.2.2:7070
Hello world (ID: 8356456912919624511)
```

Our Go app is reachable from within the cluster! But to reach our Pod we need to 
know its IP address, and as we'll see later, that's not ideal. Pods come and go, 
they may die unexpectedly.<br>
If Pods are ephemeral, so are their IP addresses. If we don't want to keep track
of which IP address corresponds to which Pod, we'll to reach Pods in a different way
(e.g., by name). But first let's deploy more stuff.

### <a href="#8" name="8">8. Let's deploy two identical Pods</a>

A simple way to (horizontally) scale our Go app would be to deploy many instances 
of it. What if we try to deploy again the same Pod?

```
$ k apply -f k8s/pod.yaml      
pod/helloworld-app unchanged
```

We cannot deploy two identical Pods. We could write another manifest 
(e.g., `./k8s/pod2.yaml`) where we give the Pod a different name (e.g., `helloworld-app2`) 
and try to deploy that:

```
$ git diff --no-index k8s/pod.yaml k8s/pod2.yaml 

diff --git a/pod.yaml b/pod2.yaml
index d04ad55..9e15e0a 100644
--- a/pod.yaml
+++ b/pod2.yaml
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Pod
 metadata:
-  name: helloworld-app
+  name: helloworld-app2
   labels:
     app: helloworld-backend
 spec:

```
$ k apply -f k8s/pod2.yaml
pod/helloworld-app2 created
```

```
$ k get pods -o wide
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE               NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
helloworld-app    1/1     Running   0          75m     10.244.2.2   minikube-lab-m03   <none>           <none>
helloworld-app2   1/1     Running   0          1m25s   10.244.1.2   minikube-lab-m02   <none>           <none>
```

There it is. Now we have two instances of our Go app running in two different Pods.
The second Pod has been scheduled to a different node (`minikube-lab-m02`) than 
the first Pod, but that won't be always the case. Notice as well that our second 
Pod got a different IP address (`10.244.1.2`).

### <a href="#9" name="9">9. Let's deploy two identical Pods (better way)</a>

You almost never deploy Pods using only a Pod manifest. K8s offers a better way to 
deploy one or more instances of your application (without having to manually create N different 
Pod manifest files): via the K8s [Deployment] object.
A K8s Deployment is a higher abstraction than the K8s Pod, and it allows us to describe
our application's lifecycle via features such as scaling, zero-downtime deployments
and rollbacks, self-healing, etc.

An application could be composed of N identical Pods 
running on multiple Nodes, each of them with their own IP address and name. 
We don't want to deal with each of them individually; we should care about the bigger picture 
(*we have one application running*), not about internal details (*our running application 
is composed of N Pods*).

Let's create a Deployment manifest to deploy our Go application:

*File `./k8s/deployment.yaml`*
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-deployment
  labels:
    app: helloworld-backend
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld-backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld-backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mypublicrepos/hello-world-go:1.0.0
        name: helloworld-container
        ports:
          - containerPort: 7070
            name: http
            protocol: TCP
```

With this manifest file we are telling K8s:

> Hey K8s, create a Deployment named `helloworld-deployment` that creates two replicated Pods. 
> The Pods should be identical (i.e., same container image and port).

Notice how the part under the `spec.template.spec` key of the manifest file is exactly 
the same as the one we had in our Pod manifest (`./k8s/pod.yaml`) under the `spec` key. 
We are, indeed, somehow _embedding_ the Pod spec in the Deployment spec. 
Let's submit the Deployment manifest to K8s and see if our Pods are created:

```
$ k apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/helloworld-deployment created

$ k get pods -o wide
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE               NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-4zdvg   1/1     Running   0          13s     10.244.2.3   minikube-lab-m03   <none>           <none>
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-g8ksc   1/1     Running   0          13s     10.244.1.3   minikube-lab-m02   <none>           <none>
```

We have two pods. Each of them were scheduled to a different node and got a 
different cluster-wide IP address. Nice. At this point we would no longer need 
our `./k8s/pod.yaml` and `./k8s/pod2.yaml` manifest files, so we could as well delete 
them because our `./k8s/deployment.yaml` is enough. Let's see what K8s has to say about 
our Deployment:

```
$ k get deployments -o wide
NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE   CONTAINERS             IMAGES                               SELECTOR
helloworld-deployment   2/2     2            2           1m    helloworld-container   mypublicrepos/hello-world-go:1.0.0   app=helloworld-backend
```

So our Deployment is managing two Pods as expected. How does our Deployment know 
about which Pods "belong" to it? Via the selector labels. In our Deployment 
manifest, the `spec.selector` defines the labels Pods should have to be managed 
by the Deployment. The label `spec.selector.matchLabels.app` has to match the label
defined in the Pod template (`spec.template.metadata.labels.app`).

### <a href="#10" name="10">10. Deployment's niceties</a>

Pods deployed via Pod manifests are also known as *static* Pods. If you delete 
a static Pod (e.g., `k delete pod helloworld-app`), the Pod is gone forever. 
The only way to scale static Pods is manually (as we saw, by creating a duplicated
Pod manifest file). That's why in real-world applications we don't usually 
deploy Pods via Pod manifests, but via Deployments. 
Deployments have all the benefits of being monitored and managed by K8s. 
Let's examine this.

Run the following command on one terminal:

```
$ k get pods --watch                  
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-8nmnh   1/1     Running   0          11s
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8   1/1     Running   0          19m
```

The `--watch` flag allows us to watch for updates in the Pods managed by our
Deployment object. On a second terminal, let's kill one of such Pods:

```
$ k delete pod helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8  
pod "helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8" deleted
```

On the first terminal we see:
```
$ k get pods --watch                  
NAME                                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-8nmnh   1/1     Running             0          11s
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8   1/1     Running             0          19m
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8   1/1     Terminating         0          19m
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-mw8gg   0/1     Pending             0          0s
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-mw8gg   0/1     Pending             0          0s
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-mw8gg   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-mw8gg   1/1     Running             0          1s
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8   0/1     Terminating         0          19m
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8   0/1     Terminating         0          19m
helloworld-deployment-79fcbf57bc-ppcb8   0/1     Terminating         0          19m
```

The Pod whose name ends in `-ppcb8` is being terminated as requested 
but not before a new Pod is created (the Pod whose name ends in `-mw8gg`) 
and ready to serve. Why does this happen?
Because in our Deployment manifest we have specified `spec.replicas: 2`, 
so K8s will constantly monitor the state of our cluster to make sure it matches 
the desired stated our manifest file represents. At the end, we'll always have
two Pods running (the old one `-8nmh` and the new one `-mw8gg`):

```

### <a href="#11" name="11">11. Accessing our Go application</a>

K8s Deployments allow us to manage multiple replicas of the same Pod. 
They also bring other niceties like self-healing (e.g., if a Pod, managed by a Deployment, 
dies, K8s takes care of creating a new Pod to substitute the dead one), and 
auto-scaling (e.g., the number of Pods managed by a Deployment can increase or decrease 
automatically based on load). But we can't still do the following:

- refer to our application by name (instead of by IP address)
- reach our application from outside the K8s cluster

For the first point we need another K8s object, the K8s [Service]. But, it's enough for today. 
let's continue tomorrow in Part II. Let's shutdown our local K8s cluster:

```
$ minikube stop -p minikube-lab
✋  Stopping node "minikube-lab"  ...
🛑  Powering off "minikube-lab" via SSH ...
✋  Stopping node "minikube-lab-m02"  ...
🛑  Powering off "minikube-lab-m02" via SSH ...
✋  Stopping node "minikube-lab-m03"  ...
🛑  Powering off "minikube-lab-m03" via SSH ...
🛑  3 nodes stopped.
```
